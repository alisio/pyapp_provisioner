# üìã Pre-Production Checklist

Use this checklist before deploying to production environments.

## ‚úÖ Configuration Validation

### Inventory Setup

- [ ] All `dest` paths use absolute paths
- [ ] Dependency types correctly specified (conda_env, requirements, or pip_list)
- [ ] Dependency files exist in repositories (for conda_env/requirements types)

### Security

- [ ] File ownership/permissions appropriate for environment
- [ ] `.vault_pass` file in `.gitignore` (if used)

## ‚úÖ Pre-Deployment Testing

### Syntax & Linting
```bash
# Syntax check
ansible-playbook playbooks/provision_apps.yml --syntax-check

# Ansible linting
ansible-lint roles/python_app

# YAML linting
yamllint .
```
- [ ] Syntax check passes
- [ ] No linting errors (warnings acceptable)

### Dry Run
```bash
# Check mode with diff
ansible-playbook playbooks/provision_apps.yml --check --diff
```
- [ ] Dry run completes without errors
- [ ] Changes shown are expected
- [ ] No unexpected file modifications

### Limited Scope Test
```bash
# Test on single host first
ansible-playbook playbooks/provision_apps.yml --limit server01
```
- [ ] Single host provisioning successful
- [ ] Services start correctly
- [ ] Applications respond as expected

### Molecule Tests (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
cd roles/python_app
molecule test
```
- [ ] All molecule tests pass
- [ ] Idempotence verified
- [ ] No unexpected changes on re-run

## ‚úÖ Dependency Installation

### Galaxy Requirements
```bash
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
```
- [ ] `mambaorg.micromamba` role installed

### Target Host Prerequisites
- [ ] Git >= 2.20 installed on all hosts
- [ ] Systemd >= 240 available (if using systemd integration)
- [ ] Sufficient disk space for repositories and environments
- [ ] Network access to package repositories (PyPI, conda-forge)

## ‚úÖ Execution Plan

### Variables Review
- [ ] `default_user` set correctly
- [ ] `micromamba_root_prefix` path appropriate
- [ ] `python_app_base_dir` has sufficient space
- [ ] Python versions available in conda-forge
- [ ] Log level appropriate for environment

### Rollback Plan

- [ ] Service downtime window planned

### Monitoring & Alerting
- [ ] Service monitoring configured (if applicable)
- [ ] Log aggregation ready to receive logs
- [ ] Alert thresholds defined
- [ ] On-call team notified

## ‚úÖ Deployment Execution

### Pre-Deployment
```bash
# Verify Ansible connectivity
ansible all -m ping

# Check disk space
ansible all -m shell -a "df -h /opt"

# Verify user exists
ansible all -m shell -a "id {{ default_user }}"
```
- [ ] All hosts respond to ping
- [ ] Sufficient disk space available
- [ ] Deploy user exists and accessible

### Deployment
```bash
# Option 1: No vault
ansible-playbook playbooks/provision_apps.yml

# Option 2: With vault password prompt
ansible-playbook playbooks/provision_apps.yml --ask-vault-pass

# Option 3: With vault password file
ansible-playbook playbooks/provision_apps.yml --vault-password-file .vault_pass

# Option 4: Verbose for troubleshooting
ansible-playbook playbooks/provision_apps.yml -vvv
```
- [ ] Playbook completes successfully
- [ ] No failed tasks
- [ ] All expected changes reported

## ‚úÖ Post-Deployment Validation

### Service Status
On each target host, verify:
```bash
# Check conda environments
micromamba env list

# Verify services (if systemd enabled)
systemctl status <app_name>.service

# Check service logs
journalctl -u <app_name>.service -n 50
```
- [ ] All conda environments created
- [ ] Services running (if enabled)
- [ ] No errors in service logs
- [ ] Applications responding to requests

### Application Testing
- [ ] HTTP endpoints responding (if applicable)
- [ ] Database connections working
- [ ] Environment variables loaded correctly
- [ ] Post-install scripts executed successfully

### File Verification
```bash
# On target hosts
ls -la /opt/apps/
ls -la ~/.micromamba/envs/
```
- [ ] Repository directories exist with correct ownership
- [ ] Conda environments present
- [ ] .env files created (if env_vars defined)
- [ ] Permissions correct (755 for dirs, 600 for .env)

### Dependency Verification
```bash
# Activate environment and check packages
micromamba run -n <env_name> pip list
```
- [ ] All required packages installed
- [ ] Correct package versions
- [ ] No dependency conflicts

## üö® Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### Common Issues

**Git clone fails:**
```bash
# Test SSH access
ssh -T git@github.com

# Check SSH keys
ssh-add -l

# Test with verbose SSH
GIT_SSH_COMMAND="ssh -v" git clone <repo_url>
```

**Conda environment errors:**
```bash
# List environments
micromamba env list

# Remove corrupted environment
micromamba env remove -n <env_name>

# Re-run with force_recreate
```

**Service won't start:**
```bash
# Check service status
systemctl status <service_name>

# View logs
journalctl -u <service_name> -xe

# Verify ExecStart command manually
cd /opt/apps/<app_name>
micromamba run -n <env_name> python main.py
```

**Permission denied:**
```bash
# Check ownership
ls -la /opt/apps/<app_name>

# Fix ownership if needed
chown -R deploy:deploy /opt/apps/<app_name>
```
